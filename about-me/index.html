      <p>
        I was born in Sweden 13 of March 2004 and as long as I have remembered I have had a curiosity for how things work. As a child my favorite toy was Lego. I liked Lego so much that my mother often couldn't get into my room because it was covered in Lego. I know that we all have had the experience of stepping on Lego, to summarize it, it's not a nice experience. 
        My favorite TV shows as a child either about cars or how you build stuff. When I look back at my childhood, the recurring theme is the need to always learn something new and curiosity. That theme is still a big part of my life.

        My need to learn hasn't gone away with age and it's still here more than ever. My biggest interests now are history, technology, cars and watches. You could say that I am a very nerdy person and I would have no problem with you saying that, because I am a very nerdy person. The thing is that I like stuff where you can always learn more, where you always can discover something new and where the field I am interested in always moves forward. That is why I like my interests so much. It's because I always can find something new to learn about.

        I have to win at everything. I always want to be the best at everything. I will do everything I can to win. In Sweden we would call a person who says that: En vinnar skalle, a winner's head or skull. Someone who always has to win and be the best at something and how will do everything in his or her power to win. I am that person how I just described plus that I am a perfectionist how I always see things that can in prouve in everything I do. This mentality goes hand in hand with my dream job, to become a Formula One engineer. As long as I can remember I have wanted to become an engineer and work with cars. But ever since I discovered motor racing and the fantastic sport Formula One I discovered my dream job. Because the sport is everything I am and my interest in F1 is gigantic, it's the perfect sport for me as I always want to learn more and F1 always delivers on that because they are on the cutting edge of technology and innovatis all of the time. It combines almost all of my interests, To be able to work with cars, different technology's and to be a part of a history writing sport. The last thing that draws me the most to this sport is that everyone working in F1 is a vinnar skallar. They will do anything in their power to win and to produce the best car. That is what I want to do in my life and is what all my goggles are with my studies.
