      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Sweden 13 of March 2004 and as long as I have remembered I have had a curiosity for how things work. As a child my favorite toy was Lego. I liked Lego so much that my mother often couldn't get into my room because it was covered in Lego. I know that we all have had the experience of stepping on Lego, to summarize it, it's not a nice experience. 
        My favorite TV shows as a child either about cars or how you build stuff. When I look back at my childhood, the recurring theme is the need to always learn something new and curiosity. That theme is still a big part of my life.

        My need to learn hasn't gone away with age and it's still here more than ever. My biggest interests now are history, technology, cars and watches. You could say that I am a very nerdy person and I would have no problem with you saying that, because I am a very nerdy person. The thing is that I like stuff where you can always learn more, where you always can discover something new and where the field I am interested in always moves forward. That is why I like my interests so much. It's because I always can find something new to learn about.
