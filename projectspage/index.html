         <p>
           This was the first project I did myself in the Teknik 1 course in gymnasium. I chose to do a RC-car which was sort of remote controlled. Instead of having the car being controlled by a wireless radio controller. You had a wired joy-stick controller sort of like what you have one your Playstation or Xbox controller.
